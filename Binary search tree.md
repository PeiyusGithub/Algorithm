#### Binary search trees  
A BST is a binary tree in symmetric order.  

Symmetric order. Each node has a key,and every node’s key is:  
・Larger than all keys in its left subtree.  
・Smaller than all keys in its right subtree.  

Operation:  
Search: If less, go left; if greater, go right; if equal, search hit.  
Insert: If less, go left; if greater, go right; if null, insert.  
delete: depend on situation.
